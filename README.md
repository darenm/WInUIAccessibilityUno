# WInUIAccessibilityUno

This is a sample application and Powerpoint Deck for the Denver Dev Day:

## WinUI, Accessibility and the Web with the Uno Platform.
Microsoft's WinUI incorporates many features to help develop desktop applications that support accessibility features such as screen readers. In this session, a simple WinUI desktop application will be extended with features from the UI Automation Framework to provide a better screen reader experience. This same application will then be compiled as a Web Assembly application using the Uno Platform. The web application will then be assessed using the web accessibility evaluation tool (WAVE), any gaps identified, and a strategy for addressing them demonstrated.
